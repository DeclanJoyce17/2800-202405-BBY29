## 4. Complete setup/installion/usage

* Go to our landing page from this link: 
* Right click anywhere on the web page
* Select Inspect at the bottom of the menu (or press F12 on your keyboard) to view developer mode.
* Select the 2nd icon, which looks like a computer with a phone, from the left next to the icon with an arrow pointing right-up.
* On the top control bar above the app, click on Dimensions: and select iPhone14 Promax.
* Now you can view or app with the latest UI updates.
* You can create a fake account in the format of an email to log in, for example user@bcit.ca, and a password.
* Optionally, if you need bigger screen size because the default screen size is too small for you, please unselect the computer with phone icon, and adjust the screen size as you wish. Our recommendation is 430 x 695 pixel to maintain relatively proper UI elements.
* After logging in, you can try different features that we have been able to implement so far.
* Finally, we would love to hear about your experience or feedback, please help us complete a small survey on this link. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fGqkebst4PxXcXgrAWfM3m8XMgkNt9S7ZDzuCHzWxME
* Thank you, I hope you will enjoy using our app.

## 5. Known Bugs and Limitations
Here are some known bugs:
* Some navigation buttons may not work yet but we still implemented them to represent the concept and enhance UI design.

## 6. Features for Future
What we'd like to build in the future:
* train the MoveNet model for pose detection so that I can give users real-time feedback on their postures and forms while exercising.
* Tasks generated by AI based on the users' level of fitness and interests.
* Text to Speech - audio streaming of chat and recommendation for users with vision impairment or working out.
